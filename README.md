# aws Training

The modules in this aws training curriculum are intended to give you some hands-on experience with aws, and highlight several core services. To follow along and see stuff happen, you don't need a ton of prerequisite knowledge. While executing the examples, you may run into problems or unexpected behavior. If that should happen, try to solve the problem - read carefully, apply your knowledge, experiment and search for answers. If you get frustrated, just ask. 

These modules cover several core aws services and concepts. These don't have to be followed in order - but it is probably better if you do. 

The modules require you to get hands-on with aws. So there are some practical prerequisites. You'll need: 
- access to an aws account
- a linux-like shell on your system that allows you to run aws CLI commands
- an IDE - vscode works well

Having some experience with vm's, programming and linux will make things easier. You'll pick up some stuff along the way, regardless.
